# MUSMUSCULUS
The objective is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between different classes of mice. The dataset includes protein expression levels in the cerebral cortex of both control and Down syndrome mice subjected to context fear conditioning. The aim is to classify the mice into eight distinct classes based on genotype, behaviour, and treatment.
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in classifying mice based on protein expression levels and identifying key discriminant proteins. 
The insights gained can significantly contribute to understanding Down syndrome and developing effective therapies. 
Future work can expand on these findings, exploring new research avenues and improving classification methodologies.
